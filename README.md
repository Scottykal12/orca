## What is Orca?

Orca is a distributed command and control (C2) system designed for managing and interacting with remote client machines. It provides a robust framework for dispatching commands, transferring files, and logging operational events across a network of registered clients. Built with Rust, Orca emphasizes performance, reliability, and secure communication, making it suitable for various remote administration and automation tasks.
